v0.1.7 (powerMediation) Nov. 08, 2013
  (1) fixed a 'NOTE': line too widths in some Rd file e.g. 'ss.SLR.Rd'
v0.1.6 (powerMediation) Nov. 08, 2013
  (1) submit to CRAN
v0.1.5 (powerMediation) April 30, 2013
  (1) add functions 'ssLong', 'ssLongFull', 'powerLong', 'powerLongFull' to calculate sample size or power for
      longitudinal study with 2 time points
v0.1.4 (powerMediation) April 29, 2013
  (1) fixed one bug in the files 'powerLogisticBin.Rd' and 'powerLogisticCon.Rd': the 'value' slot should be 'Estimated power'
  (2) fixed one bug in files 'powerLogisticBin.Rd', 'powerLogisticCon.Rd',
'SSizeLogisticBin.Rd', and 'SSizeLogisticCon.Rd': Zu should be 'u-th percentile', not 'upper u-th percentile'.
This is a typo in the file 'http://personal.health.usf.edu/ywu/logistic.pdf'
  (3) change the title in DESCRIPTION to "Power/Sample size calculation for mediation analysis, simple linear
regression, and logistic regression"

v0.1.3 (powerMediation) April 29, 2013
  (1) fixed 2 typos in DESCRIPTION file: 'continous' should be 'continuous';
'poisson' should be 'Poisson'
v0.1.2 (powerMediation) April 29, 2013
  (1) the same as v0.1.1 (failed to upload v0.1.1 and need a new version to
upload it again to CRAN)
v0.1.1 (powerMediation) April 26, 2013
  (1) add functions 'powerLogistic.OR' and 'SSizeLogistic.OR' to calculate
      power and sample size for logistic regression
v0.1.0 (powerMediation) Nov. 28, 2012
  (1) fixed 2 bugs in the file: power_VSMc_linear.R 
v0.0.9 (powerMediation)
  (1) fix a typo in man file for 'powerMediation.Sobel'

v0.0.8 (powerMediation)
  (1) Dr. George D. Papandonatos (gdp@stat.brown.edu)
      sent an e-mail to me today and kindly mentioned a few improvements
      for power calculation for Sobel test:

#############################################
Dear Weiliang,

your help file for deriving the power of the Soble test allows
users to enter sigma.m, sigma.x, theta.1a, and sigma.e as free
parameters. However,

sigma.m^2 = theta.1a^2*sigma.x^2+sigma.e^2

so that sigma.m is not a free parameter. Indeed, in the example
given in your documentation, it appears that

sigma.m = sqrt( .1701^2*.57^2+.20^2) = 0.22

which conflicts with the 0.612 value assigned to this parameter.
I belive that you should not have sigma.m as an argument to this
function.

Further, the documentation refers to sigma.m, sigma.x as variances,
whereas your code suggests they are standard deviations.

Also, you refer to sigma.theta and sigma.lambda as standard deviations,
whereas the formulae given suggest that they are variances.

v0.0.7 (powerMediation)
  (1) fixed a bug in calculating sample size/power for mediation effect
      based on Vittinghoff, Sen and McCulloch's (2009) method: corr.xm
      should be corr.xm^2 in the formula
  (2) fixed a bug in citing author names in R code or man file: the author 'Sen' was accidentally dropped.
  (3) added sample size/power calculation for logistic, poisson, and cox regression based on Vittinghoff, Sen and McCulloch's (2009) method. Thanks for Dr. Rui Wang who pointed out the sample size/power calculation formula for these 3 addition models in Vittinghoff, Sen and McCulloch (2009) and encouraged me to implement them. She even sent to me an sample R code for sample size calculation for logistic regression  for testing mediation effect.
  (4) replaced the examples in functions based on Vittinghoff, Sen and McCulloch's (2009) method
