v0.2.9 (powerMediation) Feb. 7, 2018
#  (1) refine the online manual for 'sizePoisson' and 'powerPoisson': the sample size is the total sample size
#
v0.2.8 (powerMediation) Sept. 8, 2017
  (1) Through discussion with Dr. Florence Gillaizeau <florence.gillaizeau@mxns.com>, we found
the power calculation in sizePoisson() is for two-sided test.
  (2) clarify notations in online manual
  (3) revise note section to illustrate how to obtain power for
one-sided tests

v0.2.7 (powerMediation) Feb. 15, 2017
  (1) Dr. Kimberly Henry <Kim.Henry@colostate.edu> told that typo in the
documentaion for the 'powerLongFull', 'ssLongFull' function:
  sigma1 and sigma2 are standard deviations, not variances

v0.2.6 (powerMediation) Jan. 25, 2017
  (1) Dr. Chih Ping Chou <cchou@usc.edu> pointed out that "the rho2.mx parameter is totally determined by theta1.a, sigma.x and sigma.m" in Sobel's method.
So in version 0.2.6, 'rho2.mx' is dropped from the input list.

v0.2.5 (powerMediation) June 1, 2015
  (1) figured out the answer for question proposed by Dr. George D. Papandonatos in version 0.0.8:
'sigma.m is not a free parameter'.
    Acutually 'sigma.m' is a free parameter. Note that the input 'sigma.epsilon' is not the same
as 'sigma.e'.

 Thanks Dr. Ming Ji (mji@health.usf.edu) for letting me know that I did not answer Dr. Papandonatos's question yet.

  (2) Dr. George D. Papandonatos asked another question:
----------
Dear Weiliang,

one other question: 

in the documentation for minEffect.SLR you require sigma.y as the input,  but you fail to define it. 
Is it the conditional variance of y given x? If so, why not call it sigma.e so as to avoid confusion?
Same for other functions related to SLR.

Thanks, 
----------

Answer: 
-----------
Dear George,
sigma.y is the marginal standard deviation of y, sd(y), not the conditional sd sd(y|x). Please find the attached reference paper Dupont and Plummer 1998. 

I will revise the definition of sigma.y in the next release of powerMediation. Thanks for pointing out this ambiguity! 

Best regards,

Weiliang

  (3) output round up sample size per group

v0.2.0 (powerMediation) Jan. 07, 2015
  (1) Dr. ToRe Wentzel-Larsen (tore.wentzellarsen@gmail.com) kindly pointed out that the interpretation of OR in the functions 'powerLogisticCon'
and 'SSizeLogisticCon.Rd' is not correct. The followings are his e-mail
on Jan 2, 2015. Based on Dr. ToRe Wentzel-Larsen's suggestion, I added one
phase '\eqn{\log(OR)} is the change in log odds for an increase of one unit in \eqn{X}.' to the interpretation of OR.
------------------------------
Dear Weiliang Qiu,
The formula in the documentation for this function is the same as formula (1) in the cited article by Hsieh et. al. (with beta^star written as log of the OR) However, in formula (1) in the article beta^star is not simply a regression coefficient under the alternative hypothesis, but a standardized effect size, see e. g. Appendix 1 and the Example in the article. This means that the OR has to be stated per a one standard deviation difference in the continuous independent variable in question. Perhaps that could be explicitly stated in the documentation for powerLogisticCon, since if not some users may erroneously use powerLogisticCon with the OR per one unit difference of the independent variable (although it is fairly obvious that some standardization is needed in powerLogisticCon, if not the computed power will differ as to whether the independent variable is measured in e. g. USD or 1000 USD).   
Best regards, ToRe Wentzel-Larsen

v0.0.8 (powerMediation)
  (1) Dr. George D. Papandonatos (gdp@stat.brown.edu)
      sent an e-mail to me today and kindly mentioned a few improvements
      for power calculation for Sobel test:

#############################################
Dear Weiliang,

your help file for deriving the power of the Soble test allows
users to enter sigma.m, sigma.x, theta.1a, and sigma.e as free
parameters. However,

sigma.m^2 = theta.1a^2*sigma.x^2+sigma.e^2

so that sigma.m is not a free parameter. Indeed, in the example
given in your documentation, it appears that

sigma.m = sqrt( .1701^2*.57^2+.20^2) = 0.22

which conflicts with the 0.612 value assigned to this parameter.
I belive that you should not have sigma.m as an argument to this
function.

Further, the documentation refers to sigma.m, sigma.x as variances,
whereas your code suggests they are standard deviations.

Also, you refer to sigma.theta and sigma.lambda as standard deviations,
whereas the formulae given suggest that they are variances.

#############################################


v0.0.7 (powerMediation)
  (1) fixed a bug in calculating sample size/power for mediation effect
      based on Vittinghoff, Sen and McCulloch's (2009) method: corr.xm
      should be corr.xm^2 in the formula
  (2) fixed a bug in citing author names in R code or man file: the author 'Sen' was accidentally dropped.
  (3) added sample size/power calculation for logistic, poisson, and cox regression based on Vittinghoff, Sen and McCulloch's (2009) method. Thanks for Dr. Rui Wang who pointed out the sample size/power calculation formula for these 3 addition models in Vittinghoff, Sen and McCulloch (2009) and encouraged me to implement them. She even sent to me an sample R code for sample size calculation for logistic regression  for testing mediation effect.
  (4) replaced the examples in functions based on Vittinghoff, Sen and McCulloch's (2009) method
